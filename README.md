Commands for buttons which can be rebinded.
Cout the action for the button pressed.
W, A, S, D, Arrow, Space, Backspace
Backspace used for undo.
Space == W == Up Arrow
e.g Press W = std::cout << "Jump"
Each command/keystroke recorded in macro.
Hitting backspace calls undo.


Have map in order to look up key binding. (So you know Space == W == Up)
